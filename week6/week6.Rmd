### Split trace

`add_trace` can create more traces with `split` setup.

# Analyzing Big Mac

![](bigMac.png){width="70%"}

## Chart C

![Big Mac Interaction](bigmac_chart_c.png){width="70%"}

-   Only the click-highlighted (dark blue) and the hovered grey lines are drawn.

Two events are attached to points

-   Mouse-on (aka hover) events: "add a trace of line belongs to the point's country" that fired the event. For the convenience, call it hover trace. (Constantly update that trace through hover event.)

-   Mouse-click (aka click) events: "add a trace of line belongs to the point's country" that fired the event using a trace different from hover trace. For the convenience, call it highlight trace. (Constantly update that trace through click event.)

## Plotly highlight

![Plotly highlight](plotly_highlight.png){width="70%"}

-   Two events are attached

    -   highlight-on event: attached to lines. When fired, the line that fired the event changes color, while others dim their color.

    -   highlight-off event: attached to some other graph component (see help on `highlight`). When fired, all line traces resume their original color.

# Event

-   [Event reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

Attached an mouse click event handler to an element.

-   Event is fired only when mouse clicking on that element.

-   The **event** fired is formulated as an object that is then passed to **event handler** to process and take corresponding action.

# Event handler

Plotly widget (meaning the element on .html file) fires many events. A lot of them are not attached with any handler. Like setting `hoverinfo='none'` will still have a Plotly widget fire hover event. We can attach event handler to that ad hoc, via **Plotly.js**

## Design a handler

We need to know that information the corresponding event can pass to us.

First save what we have

```{r}
saveRDS(bigMac2, "bigMac2.Rds")
```

We can place the following code in the dashboard:

```{r}
bigMac2 = readRDS("bigMac2.Rds")

bigMac2$highlightLayer$lines |> 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("function(e){plt=e;}")
```

The above code will pass a function to handle the DOM object associated with the widget (which is the plotly plot target). The plotly plot target will be passed to the function as its input argument e. The handler will create an object called `plt` to represent `e` which will be our plotly plot target.

The symbol of the input argument can be any label besides `e`. You can name it anything not too irregular.

> In Javascript, creating an object without declaration will put that object in its **global environment**.
>
> ``` javascript
> let a = 3; //will not put object a in the global environment.
> b = 4; //will put object b in the global environment.
> ```

And knit, and browse it in Chrome. A web page has a Javascript runtime associated with it.

## Chrome inspector

![Chrome inspector](chrome_inspector.png){style="width: 50%"}

Under console, you can do a **name call** on any object existing in the global environment of the runtime, such as `plt`. An object that represents an element in a web page is called a DOM element.

## Attach plotly event handler

``` javascript
//js
plt.on('plotly event', event handler)
```

-   [Plotly events](https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#using-plotlyjs-events)

-   If we want to know what information an **event** can carry, we can set the event handler as

    `function(e){ console.log(e) }`

    -   `console.log(e)` will print the value of object `e` in the console window.

## Chrome sources snippet

![Sources/snippets](script_snippet.png)

### Plotly hover event

-   [plotly hover event](https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#hover-event)

Put this under the snippet and save (ctrl+S, or cmd+S).

``` javascript
//js
plt.on('plotly_hover', function(e){
    console.log(e)
})
```

Run it and do a hover action, you will see hover event shown in the console. You can right click the console information and **store it as global variable** for experiment.
